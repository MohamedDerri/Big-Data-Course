## Introduction

In today's digital age, we generate an enormous amount of data every day, and analyzing that data is crucial for businesses and organizations to make informed decisions. This is where Big Data comes into play - a field that deals with the management and analysis of large and complex data sets.

Through this course, I will be learning about various Big Data technologies and their applications in real-world scenarios. This GitHub repository serves as a platform for me to showcase my understanding and skills gained throughout the course.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to document my progress in the Big Data course and demonstrate my proficiency in the technologies covered. Additionally, it will serve as a reference for future projects and job opportunities.

## Technologies Covered

Throughout the course, I will be studying and working with the following technologies:

- MapReduce
- Hadoop
- Apache Spark
- Apache SQL
- And more

## Assignment Structure

Each day, I will be completing a new assignment related to the technologies covered in the course. Each assignment will be uploaded to its respective folder in this repository, along with any necessary documentation or data files.

I hope this repository will not only serve as evidence of my skills but also inspire others to dive into the exciting field of Big Data.
